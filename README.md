Title: The prevalence of US adult disability by region and age in 2018.
The primary objectives: (1)the association between disability prevalence and age, and (2)the association between prevalence of different types of disability across the US, especially between cognitive disability and mobidity disability. There are also other specific research questions were addressed, please see more detail on my website and in the written report. 
The data could be downloaded from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention at https://data.cdc.gov/Disability-Health/DHDS-Prevalence-of-Disability-Status-and-Types-by-/qjg3-6acf. I also included the downloaded raw data in the "data" folder under my repository. 
The key findings are that a positive association was observed between the prevalence of disability using the 2018 state- or region-level data in the US, and a higher prevalence of any kind of disability is associated with aging. The proportion of people living with any type of disability is the highest in the south of the US.
